#### This is the most amamzing part of the research, to create a webpage and connect it to backend.

we chose to create a UI because, in today's world every one is more into easily thing not into how it is done.

To do so a main.html was provided in the templates directory.

From Code directory just install the requirement.

Now, open the webpage.py in a python compiler, and just run it, it will give you a link copy that and open it in any browser.

Finally, this what our webpage looks like.
