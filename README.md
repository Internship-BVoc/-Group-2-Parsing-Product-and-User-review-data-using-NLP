    b. webpage.py - to make our research more understandable we use a UI or a webpage which is made using flask, this webpage contains all the required button to print the result.

2. UI - 

    a. templates - in this directory a "main.html" is present which is used for the UI design and this single file does all the work, no external HTML required for Buttons or any other action to get performed.
